## About The Project
## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS ‚ö†Ô∏è
![Screen Shot](main.jpg)


Here I'll try to explain and show how I made this custom alarm panel for Home Assistant with a NodeMCU ESP8266

## Parts

* NodeMCU v3 ESP8266
* Matrix 4x4 Keypad
* RC522
* Resistors:
  * x1 47Œ©

*Jumper Wires
- Patience and Creativity üòÜ

## Getting Started

We'll start with the Keypad, in this case I will be using a 4x4 one, you can use a 4x3 but you will need to change some things in [_keypad_custom.h_](https://github.com/aronkahrs-us/ESPHome-Alarm-Panel-Keypad-Rfid-Display/blob/main/ESPHome/keypad_custom.h).

We could use 8 Digital pins of our NodeMCU to connect the keypad, _and if you only want the keypad functionality it's recommended_, but we still need to connect the RC522 and the Display, so we'll really need those pins later, what we are going to do to "free" pins is basically turning the keypad into a selectable voltage divider circuit, where each button is selecting a different divider configuration, resulting in a different voltage which we'll be measuring to determine which key was pressed.



### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)

2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```
